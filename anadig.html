        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO ANALOG AND DIGITAL TRANSMISSION</h3>

        <p>Electronic Data can be of two kinds:
            <br>
            Analog and Digital
        </p>

        <div class="analog">
            <p><span>Analog Data</span>take on continuous values as time changes. In other words, it is 
                represented by a continuous physical quantity whose magnitude is proportional to 
                25</p>

            <p>a suitable function of the data (information). It can have more than two discrete 
                values in contrast to digital data E.g., 
            </p>

            <p>Voice - uses microphone to convert to electrical form</p>

            <p>Video - uses video camera</p>
            <p>Temperature - uses sensor, like thermocouples
            </p>
            <p>Pressure - uses piezoelectric crystals
            </p>
            <p>Digital Data - take on discrete values, switching ON/OFF, text, integers, etc.
                Can be grouped into 
                Bits - either a voltage or no voltage, 0 or 1
            </p>
            <p>Bytes - group of 8 bits, like 0100 0001 </p>

            <p>In a communication system, data are propagated from one point to another by means of 
                electromagnetic signals. A signal is a series of analog or digital data. That is a varying 
                voltage (either continuous or discrete) with time in an electronic communication system.
                Amplitude, frequency and phase are the attributes of a signal that changes with time.
                Viewed as a function of time, an electromagnetic signal can be either analog or digital.
                Analog Signals - A continuously varying electromagnetic wave representing data that 
                may be propagated over a variety of media. In other words, is one in which the signal 
                intensity varies in a smooth fashion over time. There are no breaks or discontinuities in 
                the signal. </p>
                <p>Digital Signal - A discrete or discontinuous signal, such as a sequence of voltage pulses
                    representing data transmitted over a wire medium. In other words, is one in which the 
                    signal intensity maintains a constant level for some period of time and then changes to 
                    another constant (discrete) level.eg
