      <h3>COMMUNICATION PATTERNS</h3>

      <p>
        Depending on the application, communication pattern can be one of
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>One-to-one (1:1) communication:</li>

        <p>
          This is the type of communication between one sender and one receiver.
          It is also referred to as unicast communication. Examples client
          server communication and web browsing.
        </p>

        <li>One-to-many (1:n) communication:</li>

        <p>
          In this case one sender communicates with more than one receiver. This
          can either be broadcast where the sender communicates with all the
          receivers or multicast when the sender communicates with some group of
          the receivers
        </p>

        <li>Many-to-one (m:1) Communication:</li>

        <p>
          This is the type of communication between many senders and only one
          receiver. It is also commonly referred to as Concast.
        </p>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
