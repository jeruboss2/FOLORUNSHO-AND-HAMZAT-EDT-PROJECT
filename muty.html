        <h4>MULTIPLEXING</h4>
        
        <p>
            Multiplexing is a process that combines several signals for simultaneous transmission on 
            one transmission channel. Most of the transmission systems in the telecommunications 
            network contain more capacity than is required by a single user. It is economically 
            feasible to utilize the available bandwidth of optical fiber or coaxial cable or a radio 
            system in a single high-capacity system shared by multiple users. Sharing one media by 
            multiple users is known as multiplexing. It is a technique employed in many different 
            situations where different signals have to share a medium, circuit or channel. It enables 
            more efficient use of circuits or facilities.

                    Multiplexing voice telephone calls means two or more conversations are sent 
                    simultaneously over one circuit.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Multiplexing data means two or more messages are simultaneously sent over one 
                    circuit.

            A Demultiplexer does the opposite of a multiplexer; it separates a multiplexed signal 
            back into its separate signals, for distribution to multiple users.

            <h5>Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)</h5>

            <p>
                FDM is an analog technique where each signal or device is allocated a separate range of 
                frequencies to use on the channel. This is similar to AM radio, for example, where each 
                radio station transmits its signal on a different carrier frequency (the allocated spectrum 
                is 20 1100KHz, from 550KHz to 1650KHz, and that can accommodate 1100KHz/10KHz = 110 channels). 
                The signals are all present on the medium at the same time but they don't interfere with each 
                other because each one is modulated onto a different carrier frequency. This FDM technique is 
                less efficient, requires more maintenance and is less flexible than TDM.

            <h5>Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)</h5>

            <p>
                TDM is a digital technique in which different signals take turns using the available channel. 
                Each signal uses the entire bandwidth for a short time and then waits for its turn again. Each 
                user channel uses a wider frequency band but only for a small fraction of time; each signal 
                having its own timeslot, much like boxcars on a train where each car carries freight for one user. 
                The difference is that the sequence of boxcars repeats itself endlessly. This method of TDM is used 
                in high-capacity transmission systems such as optical line systems but also in digital cellular 
                networks where we call it time-division multiple access (TDMA). One user occupies one time slot 
                of a frame, and the time division principle allows multiple users to access the network at the same 
                time using the same carrier frequency.
